# Infrastructure management

While development usually [starts locally with ZenML](../../starter-guide/starter-guide.md), very quickly it is desirable to deploy workloads into production outside the local development machine. Therefore, many other infrastructure components come into play.

This guide helps build an understanding of such components:

- [Understanding various development environments](understanding-environments.md).
- Learning about various means to [connect to ZenML](connecting-to-zenml.md)
- [Dockerization](containerize-your-pipeline.md) of your pipeline.
- [Scaling to the cloud](scale-compute-to-the-cloud.md).
- [Setting up a minimal GCP stack](cloud-stacks/minimal-gcp-stack.md)
